                        <b>Olive Oil :</b> Or use vegetable oil.

                        <b>Bell Peppers :</b> Be colorful here. Use a mix of green, red and orange bell peppers. Yellow is great, too.

                        <b>Coconut Milk :</b> Heavy cream is an acceptable alternative, yet won't bring that coconut flavor.

            <ol>
                <li> <b> Cook the Jerk Spiced Chicken :</b> Heat the olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Season the chopped chicken
                         with Jamaican jerk seasonings, paprika, and salt and pepper. Add the chicken and cook 6-7 minutes, or until
                         cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>



                <li> <b> Cook the Onions and Peppers :</b> Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan and add the onion and peppers. Cook them down about 5 minutes to soften.
                         Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon Jamaican jerk seasoning. Cook for 1 minute, stirring.</li>



                <li> <b> Add the Liquids :</b> Add the chicken stock, coconut milk, and reserved chicken. Simmer for 5 minutes to thicken up.
                         If it gets too thick, swirl in a few tablespoons of water or chicken stock, or use a bit of reserved pasta water. </li>



                <li> <b> Stir in the Parmesan cheese :</b> and remove from heat for delicious creamy pasta. While the Rasta Pasta is simmering,
                         cook the penne noodles in a large pot according to the package instructions to al dente.</li>



                 <li> <b> Drain and toss with the sauce :</b> It is so rich and creamy at this point. Already delicious and full of flavor.</li>
